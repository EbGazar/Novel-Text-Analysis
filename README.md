## Novel Text Analysis

Using web scraping and NLP to analysis the words in one of two pieces of classic literature: Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, or Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie.

### Project Description

Scraping a novel from the website [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). Then apply words extraction from this web data using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), then dive into Text Analyzing using the [Natural Language ToolKit (nltk)](https://www.nltk.org/).

`The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.`
